# Overview

FS3 is a dedicated storage service for the Filecoin network. It is committed to creating a simpler and faster storage calculation for the Filecoin network. Similarly to the widely used S3 object storage tool, FS3 can also handle structured and unstructured data, including log files, artifacts, backups, container images, photos and videos.&#x20;

With FS3, industry users can migrate their codes to the Filecoin network without redesigning the system. Ecosystem developers can use FS3 as a local container to communicate directly with Filecoin or deploy images to AWS or other cloud services that provide communication with Filecoin. Managed platforms such as Powergate and FilSwan can add FS3 as a service component and integrate it into their current infrastructure.
