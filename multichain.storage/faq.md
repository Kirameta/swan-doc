# FAQ

Q: Is Multichain Storage free?

A: For Onchain Storage, we bill separately according to the size of the uploaded files. For Bucket Storage, we bring 30G of free storage space for each user, which you can use to upload files or folders. And more than 30G of space will be charged.

&#x20;

Q: What is the maximum size of the bucket? Can we increase it?

A: For now, you can upload unlimited files or folders to a Bucket as long as you upload less than 30G. If you need more storage or upload a single object of more than 30G, don't hesitate to get in touch with us via the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/KKGhy8ZqzK).

Q: What is “IPFS waste space limit reached: too many files uploaded to IFS but unpaid, please pay or unpin them before uploading new files.”

A: When you have uploaded a total of more than 1G file using Onchain Storage, and the payment fails, you will not be able to continue paying Onchain Storage. You need to make the payment or unpin the unpaid files to continue uploading files.

&#x20;

Q: How will I request a refund?

A: You can issue a refund request on Onchain Storage's page, and the system will perform the refund upon receipt of the request.

Q: How does multichain.storage work?

A: Multi-Chain storage (MCS) enables users to pay for Filecoin storage with stablecoins and other Mainnet tokens while maintaining data security. Users will also obtain the payment transaction and IPFS information with Filecoin deal ID for future reference.

Q： How does FilSwan ensure security and stability?

A： Security is guaranteed by the protocol layer of each L1 chain. We have also invited many well-known security companies to do audits. In terms of storage security, FilSwan currently has access to 190 storage service providers worldwide, covering five continents, is very decentralized, and each data has more than five backups. I think the infrastructure support we have now will help with the service stability.

Q: How do I pin a file to IPFS?

A: All files uploaded to multichain.storage have been pinned to IPFS automatically. You can get an IPFS link to share the files. In the Onchain Storage Page, you can immediately get the CID and mint the file to OpenSea as an NFT with one click.

Q: Can I use multichain.storage for decentralized application (dApp) storage?

A: Yes, we have multiple SDK tools support. Check them on our GitHub page [here](https://github.com/filswan).
