{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Depends on if you have a private key or not, you can either import the private key to create a wallet; or, you can create a wallet directly. It's very important to remember the mnemonic and private key. If you lost it, you can also enter the wallet and export the private key.
{% endhint %}

### 2. Add Polygon Mainnet

Add a custom RPC network to connect your wallet account to the Polygon mainnet, configure Polygon mainnet parameters as follow:

| Parameters         | Value                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Network Name       | Polygon Mainnet                                      |
| RPC URL            | [https://polygon-rpc.com/](https://polygon-rpc.com/) |
| ChainID            | 137                                                  |
| Symbol             | MATIC                                                |

After the parameters are configured, click 'Save' button below and successfully add Polygon mainnet.&#x20;

If you want to add more wallet accounts, you can create them by importing the private key of your existing other wallets; or, you can directly click Create Account, and remember to save the private key after creation.
