# Basic Concept

### Task

In the Swan project, a task can contain one or multiple offline deal(s).

&#x20;_****_ :file\_folder:_**Task type: There are two basic types of tasks:**_

* **Public Task**: A deal set for open bid. It has 2 types:
  * Auto-bid: an auto-bid task will be automatically assigned to a selected storage provider based on reputation system and Market Matcher.
  * Manual-bid: after bidder winning the bid, the task holder needs to propose the manual-bid task to the winner.
* **Private Task**: It is required to propose deal(s) of a private task to a specified storage provider.

_****_:file\_folder:_**Task status:**_

* **Created**: A task is created successfully first time on Swan platform, regardless of its type.
* **Assigned**: A task has been assigned to a storage provider manually by users or automatically by auto-bid module: Market Matcher.
*   **ActionRequired**: An autobid task, that is, `bid_mode=1` and `public_deal=true`, has some information missing or invalid:

    * MaxPrice: missing, or is not a valid number
    * FastRetrieval: missing
    * Type: missing, or not have valid values
    * No offline deal for this task.

    ðŸ””You need to solve the above problems and change the task status to `Created` to participate next run of Market Matcher.
* **DealSent**: All offline deal(s) of this task has(have) been sent to a storage provider which has been assigned to this task.
* **ProgressWithFailure**: Some and not all of the deals of the task have been sent to a storage provider which has been assigned to this task.

### Offline Deal

* Each offline deal contains information about a car file generated from the client tool.
* The size of a car file can be up to 64GB.
* Every step of this tool will generate a JSON file which contains file(s) description like below:

```

 }
]
```

* This JSON file generated in each step will be used in its next step and can be used to rebuild the graph in the future.
* Uuid is generated for future index purposes.
