# Basic Concept

### Task

* A task can contain one or multiple car files
* Each car file can be sent to one or multiple miners
* Methods to set miners for each car file in a task
  * **Auto-bid**: `task.bid_mode=1`, Market Matcher will automatically allocate miners for each car file based on the reputation system and the max copy number the task needs.
  * **Manual-bid**: `task.bid_mode=0`, After bidders win the bid, the task holder needs to propose the task to the winners.
  * **None-bid**: `task.bid_mode=2`, It is required to propose each car file of a task to a list of specified miners.
*   Task Status:

    * **Created**: After a task is created, its initial status is `Created` regardless of its type.
    *   **ActionRequired**: An autobid task, that is, `task.bid_mode=1`, has some information missing or invalid:

        * MaxPrice: missing, or is not a valid number
        * FastRetrieval: missing
        * Type: missing, or not having valid value

        ðŸ””You need to solve the above problems and change the task status to `Created` to participate next run of Market Matcher.

    ### Car file

    * A car file is an independent unit to be sent to miners
    * Each car file can be sent to one or multiple miners
    * A car file is generated from source file(s) by Lotus, Graph-split, or Ipfs
    * The size of a car file can be up to 64GB.
    *   Car File Status:

        * **Created**: After a task is created, all its car files are in this status
        * **ActionRequired**: An autobid task, that is, `task.bid_mode=1`, its car file has something missing or invalid:
          * FileSize: missing, or is not a valid number
          * FileUrl: missing
          * StartEpoch: missing, or not have valid value, less than 0, or current epoch
          * PayloadCid: missing
          * PieceCid: missing
        * **Assigned**: When its task is in auto-bid mode, that is, `task.bid_mode=1`, a car file has been assigned to a list of miners automatically by Market Matcher.

        ### Offline Deal

        An offline Deal means the transaction that a car file is sent to a miner

        * Offline Deal Status:
          * **Assigned**: Only in auto-bid mode, that is `task.bid_mode=1`, when a miner is assigned to a car file, an offline deal record is created, and its status is `Assigned`.
          * **Created**: For all the bid modes, after a car file is sent to a miner, the related deal status is `Created`.
          * **...**: There are several other statuses, which are generated and used by Swan Provider and Swan Platform and they have the same meaning for tasks of all bid modes.
        * Every step of this tool will generate a JSON file that contains file(s) description like the one of below:
