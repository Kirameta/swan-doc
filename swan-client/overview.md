# OVERVIEW

## If you are a client who wants to send deals, Swan Client provides the following functions:

1. Generate CAR files from your source files by Lotus, Graph-split, or IPFS.
2. Generate metadata e.g. CAR file URI, start epoch, etc., and save them to a metadata JSON file.
3. Propose deals based on the metadata JSON file.
4. Generate a final JSON file containing deal CIDs and storage provider ids for storage providers to import deals.
5. Create tasks and offline deals on [Swan Platform](broken-reference).
6. Send deals automatically to auto-bid storage providers.
