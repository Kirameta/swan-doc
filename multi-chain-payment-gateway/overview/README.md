  technology for FIleocoin

# Overview



Filecoin as a storage solution leading in decentralized storage market is used by lots of famous blockchain projects.e.g. Near,Polygon.it is also used by projects in NFT, deep learning. However, Filecoin blockchain currently only support Fil as the payment token while lots of storage solutions like nft.storage, web3.storage provide free storage base on verified deals, but there is no free meal in the long run. We need a decentralized payment solutions for Filecoin projects.

Our solution is building on a Defi based multi-chain solutions to converting major cryptocurrencies to filecoin payment. With the defi base pricing it can fast react to the price changes from dex and make the payment smoothly and lowest Trading slippage.



### Value

With our defi payment solution, it can help the ecosystem projects easily integrated multi-coin payment to their system. Projects can use metamask pay eth, USDC, matic or other token for their storage cost. If the project cannot implemented properly, it will delay the process of lots of ecosystem projects integrated with other blockchain.

The risks of make executing on this project difficult are:

* Smart contracts. There are so many token in the world, we need to create lots of smart contracts, they all needed to be audited for preventing fatal bugs
* User adaption. After implementation there are huge effort needed for marketing and user training.
