# FAQ

* How can I check the swan-provider version?

The `./swan-provider` command allows you to interact with a running swan provider daemon. Check the current version of your swan-provider

```
./swan-provider version
```

*   My aria2 is not downloaded

    Please check if aria2 is running

    ```
    ps -ef | grep aria2
    ```
*   error msg="no response from swan platform‚Äù

    Please check your `api_url` is correct, it should be `https://go-swan-server.filswan.com`

For usage questions or issues reach out to the Swan Provider team either in the [Discord channel](http://discord.com/invite/KKGhy8ZqzK) or open a new issue here on GitHub.
