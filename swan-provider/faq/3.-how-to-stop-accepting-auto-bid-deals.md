# 3. How to stop accepting "auto-bid" deals?

You can set `[bid].bid_mode = 0` in the configuration file `config.toml`.

> Please restart Swan Provider after completing the configuration.

In addition, if you'd like to set the number of deals allowed to be received per day, you can just modify the`[bid].auto_bid_deal_per_day = 100` according to your needs.
