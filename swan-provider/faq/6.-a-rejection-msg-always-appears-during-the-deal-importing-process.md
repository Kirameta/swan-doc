# 6. A rejection msg always appears during the deal-importing process

First, you can check whether the deal is rejected:

```
lotus-miner stroage-deals list -v| grep <deal_cid>
```

If the deal is rejected, please check whether the filter is set correctly in the configuration file `[Dealmaking]` of the storage provider as shown below:

```
[Dealmaking]
  Filter = "/home/test/dealfilter.pl"
```

Deals sent from the address in the `denylist` cannot be imported. You can check the `denylist`in the `dealfilter.pl` and add/delete addresses according to your needs.

```
#!/usr/bin/perl

# print "Miner currently upgrading - BACK SOON";
# exit 1;
