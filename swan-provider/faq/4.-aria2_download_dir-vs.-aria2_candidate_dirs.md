# 4. \`aria2\_download\_dir\` vs. \`aria2\_candidate\_dirs\`

In the latest **v2.2.0-rc1**,&#x20;

* `aria2_download_dir` is the only path where CAR files can be downloaded;&#x20;
* `aria2_candidate_dirs` is the path where CAR files can pre-exist, and files downloaded through Swan Provider will not be saved under this path.

If the CAR files of the storage provider's deals are all downloaded through Swan Provider, `aria2_download_dir`and `aria2_candidate_dirs` can be set to the same.&#x20;

If the CAR files of storage providers' deals are stored in local paths before the deals are sent, these paths can be configured in `aria2_candidate_dirs`, and multiple directories are supported.&#x20;

After the deals are sent, Swan Provider will give priority to searching the corresponding CAR files of the deals from the `aria2_candidate_dirs` directory.

> Note: To make full use of the data reading performance of a single path, Swan Provider only supports one file to be imported in one single path.
