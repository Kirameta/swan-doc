# Economic System

1. **Base Income (UBI) for Nodes**:
   * **Purpose**: To ensure that nodes remain active and available, even during periods of low job availability.
   * **Eligibility**: Nodes must have a reputation score of at least 60. If a node doesn't secure a job after 6000 blocks, it's blacklisted. Nodes must also prove their hardware ownership through a zk-proof mechanism, ensuring genuine resource contribution.
   * **Adjustment**: If the percentage of nodes receiving UBI exceeds a certain threshold, the system generates additional system jobs to reduce reliance on UBI.
2. **Dynamic Pricing**:
   * **Purpose**: To balance the supply and demand in the network and ensure fair compensation.
   * **Mechanism**: The pricing is adjusted based on the UBI and the baseline model. As the total jobs in the network increase or decrease, the incentives for job completion adjust accordingly.
3. **Compensation for Job Creators**:
   * **Purpose**: To incentivize the creation of genuine tasks and ensure a steady flow of jobs in the system.
   * **Mechanism**: Job creators are rewarded for bringing tasks to the network.
4. **Reputation System**:
   * **Purpose**: To promote good behavior and high-quality service within the network.
   * **Mechanism**: Nodes earn a reputation score based on their performance. Only nodes with a score above a certain threshold qualify for UBI.
5. **Proof of Eligibility**:
   * **Purpose**: To ensure that nodes are genuinely providing the resources they claim to have.
   * **Mechanism**: Nodes periodically submit zk-proofs to demonstrate their hardware ownership without revealing the actual resources.
6. **Penalties and Blacklisting**:
   * **Purpose**: To maintain the overall health and efficiency of the network.
   * **Mechanism**: Nodes that consistently underperform or remain inactive are blacklisted. Additionally, nodes that fail to provide services as promised face penalties.
7. **System Job Generation**:
   * **Purpose**: To ensure there are always enough jobs in the system.
   * **Mechanism**: If the percentage of nodes on UBI exceeds a threshold, the system generates additional jobs. This reduces the reliance on UBI and promotes active participation.
8. **Tokenomics (SWAN Token)**:
   * **Purpose**: To facilitate transactions within the network and serve as a measure of value.
   * **Mechanism**: The SWAN token, operating as an Ethereum L2 token, is used for compensations, incentives, and as collateral. Nodes might need to stake a certain amount of SWAN tokens as collateral, which can be slashed for misbehavior.
9. **Incentive for Active Participation**:
   * **Purpose**: To ensure nodes actively seek out jobs rather than relying solely on UBI.
   * **Mechanism**: The rewards for completing jobs are designed to be more lucrative than UBI, encouraging nodes to actively participate.

In essence, the SWAN network's economic system is a delicate balance of incentives and penalties, designed to promote active participation, ensure fairness, and maintain the network's overall health. The use of modern cryptographic proofs, dynamic pricing, and a reputation system further ensures the network's robustness and integrity.
