Multichain computing protocol(MCP) is an open-sourced standard for developers to easily build secure multi-chain services and applications. With a universal bridging interface, developers can utilize resources across multiple blockchain networks including computing, storage, and bandwidth, eliminating the need for developers to write agile code for fast cross-chain integrations. MCP opens a new category of web3 applications that can be built by developers for multi-chain ecosystems.

**Protocol Requirements**

In order to enable a new class of web3 native dApps, a Decentralized Query Protocol must meet the following requirements:

1. Web3 Resource Discovery:  client should be able to get the web3 resources with minimum effort on the network
2. Data availability: a client should be able to pay to keep the data available for running queries against specific data sources.&#x20;
3. Price efficiency: clients should be able to pay for data, bandwidth, and computing resource availability in efficient and competitive marketplaces.&#x20;
4. Incentive alignmentâ€”incentives should be aligned between clients, providers, and dApp de- velopers to encourage growth of the network and positive network effects.&#x20;
