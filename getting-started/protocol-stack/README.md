# Protocol Stack

Multichain computing protocol(MCP) is an open-sourced standard for developers to easily build secure multi-chain services and applications. With a universal bridging interface, developers can utilize resources across multiple blockchain networks including computing, storage, and bandwidth, eliminating the need for developers to write agile code for fast cross-chain integrations. MCP opens a new category of web3 applications that can be built by developers for multi-chain ecosystems.

**Protocol Requirements**

In order to enable a new class of web3 native dApps, a Decentralized Query Protocol must meet the following requirements:

1. Web3 Resource Discovery:  client should be able to get the web3 resources with minimum effort on the network
2. Data availability: a client should be able to pay to keep the data available for running queries against specific data sources.&#x20;
3. Price efficiency: clients should be able to pay for data, bandwidth, and computing resource availability in efficient and competitive marketplaces.&#x20;
4. Incentive alignment—incentives should be aligned between clients, providers, and dApp de- velopers to encourage growth of the network and positive network effects.&#x20;

## Protocol Layers

1\.     Cross-chain Consensus Layer—responsible for smart contract execution and payment settlement.

2\.     Peer-to-peer (P2P) Network—defines how nodes locate and connect.

3\.     Payment Channels—facilitates fast and low-cost payments in the system.

4\.     Service Discovery – Server nodes and reputation module for public service

5\.     Data Marketplace—the mechanism by which users pay nodes for the dataset.

6\.     Indexing and Caching Marketplace—the mechanism by which users pay nodes for indexing and caching data sources.

7\.     Web3 Task bid market – public and private task, market matcher, auto bidding

8\.     Storage Layer—data stored on public blockchains or content addressable networks.

9\.     Computing Layer—how a query is routed to a specific node for computing.

10\.  CDN Layer – how data is distributed and hosted on the global network

11\.  Governance—manages schemas, treasure, and disputes.
