# Grants

#### **Swan Grants Matching Mechanism for Job Creators:**

**1. Matching Percentage:**

* For every job placed by a creator, SWAN will match a certain percentage (x%) of the cost. This acts as an incentive for creators to place jobs as they get additional value for their investment.

**2. Cap on Matching:**

* To ensure that the system is not overly burdened and to maintain fairness, there's a cap on the matching amount. No matter how large the job's cost, the maximum amount SWAN will match is capped at 100 Tokens per job.

**3. Example:**

* If a creator places a job that costs 500 Tokens:
  * At a 10% match, SWAN would contribute an additional 50 Tokens.
  * At a 50% match, SWAN would contribute an additional 250 Tokens.
  * However, if the matching percentage leads to an amount greater than 100 Tokens, only 100 Tokens will be matched due to the cap.

**4. Periodic Review:**

* The matching percentage and cap can be reviewed periodically based on the funds available, the number of jobs being placed, and the overall health of the SWAN ecosystem. Adjustments can be made to ensure sustainability.

**5. Eligibility Criteria:**

* To avoid misuse, certain eligibility criteria can be set for job creators to qualify for the matching. This could include factors like the quality of jobs, past track record, and alignment with SWAN's objectives.
