## Public Testnet Guide <a href="#__docusaurus" id="__docusaurus"></a>

In order to make it easy for people to get started using MCP, we've launched our MCP on the Mumbai testnet.

### Connecting to the chain <a href="#connecting-to-the-chain" id="connecting-to-the-chain"></a>

If you're using Metamask, add a custom RPC network to connect to the Mumbai testnet:

* Network Name: Mumbai Testnet
* RPC URL: [https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com](https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com)
* ChainID: 80001
* Symbol: MATIC
* Block Explorer URL: [https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com)

### Observing transactions <a href="#observing-transactions" id="observing-transactions"></a>

If you'd like to see your transactions in action, please check out [block explorer](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com)!

There you'll be able to see all the transactions being executed in MCP and also see exactly how much Gas each transaction uses.
