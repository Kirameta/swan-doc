# Overview

Filecoin as a storage solution leading in decentralized storage market is used by lots of famous blockchain projects. e.g. Near, Polygon. It is also used by projects in NFT, deep learning. However, Filecoin blockchain currently only support FIL as the payment token while lots of storage solutions like nft.storage, web3.storage provide free storage base on verified deals, but there is no free meal in the long run. We need a decentralized payment solutions for Filecoin projects.

Our solution is building on a DeFi based multi-chain solutions to converting major cryptocurrencies to Filecoin payment. With the DeFi based pricing it can fast react to the price changes from DEX and make the payment smoothly and lowest Trading slippage.

## Introduction

Multi-Chain Storage (MCS) is a smart contract based cross chain storage gateway, which is integrated with oracle technology for Filecoin storage. It enabled users the capability to pay Filecoin storage with stable coin and other Mainnet tokens, while maintaining security. Users will also obtain the payment transaction and IPFS information with Filecoin deal ID for future reference.

#### Offering Flexible Payment Options

MCS allows users to use other blockchain tokens besides Filecoin as a payment solution. With this solution, users who are interested in storing data on the Filecoin network have access to flexible and trusted payment methods.

#### Zero Cost, Free To Use

MCS creates more secure data storage through Filecoin Calibration network with no service fee. The service is free while we continue designing and testing the reporting, proofs, and oracles needed to make the system trustless and open to everyone. During this Beta version, users can acquire Testnet USDC and MATIC tokens from [Swan Faucet](../../development-resource/swan-token-contract/acquire-testnet-usdc-and-matic-tokens.md) to use our service for storing data on Filecoin Calibration network.

#### Access by Wallet (MetaMask)

MCS is easy for users to use. There are no accounts or API keys needed to setup and use. Users just need an address on Polygon Mumbai (e.g. using Metamask). Any address can push data to Filecoin via the bridge as long as they have access to the private keys of the identity to sign their requests.&#x20;

#### Seamless Integration, Easy To Implement

Easy to use with NFT, FS3 and all kinds of ecosystem projects! ETH, USDC, MATIC or other tokens will all be available with Swan MCS and MetaMask.

## Value

With our DeFi based multi-chain storage solution, it can help the ecosystem projects easily integrate multi-chain storage to their system. Projects can use Metamask pay USDC, MATIC or other tokens for the storage cost. If the project cannot implemented properly, it will delay the process of lots of ecosystem projects integrated with other blockchain.

#### The risks of make executing on this project difficult are:

* Smart contracts. There are so many token in the world, we need to create lots of smart contracts, they all needed to be audited for preventing fatal bugs.
* User adaption. After implementation there are huge effort needed for marketing and user training.
