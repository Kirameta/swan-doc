## Public Testnet Guide <a href="#__docusaurus" id="__docusaurus"></a>

In order to make it easy for people to get started using Multi-Chain Storage, we've launched our MCS on the Mumbai testnet.

### Connecting to the chain <a href="#connecting-to-the-chain" id="connecting-to-the-chain"></a>

If you're using Metamask, add a custom RPC network to connect your wallet account to the Mumbai Testnet. [Click here to view more info](../mcp-user-guide/setup-metamask.md)

### Observing transactions <a href="#observing-transactions" id="observing-transactions"></a>

If you'd like to see your transactions in action, please check out [block explorer](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)!

At there you'll be able to see all the transactions being executed in MCS and also see exactly how much Gas each transaction uses.
